        <p class="lead">Hello there everyone. I am a computer science major student at csulb and I really love things involving the computer. One of the main reason I wanted to choose computer science as my major was really because I interacted with them ever since I could remember. I would always be playing with a computer since my dad was someone who worked with a computer, and because of this I am who I am today. All the friends I have today is because we all have similar interest
        
        for the computer. Everything you can do with a computer like watching videos and playing games are just parts of why I love computer science. Computers are just really interesting and very great for either work or entertainment. Long story short, I really wanted to get a job involving the computer because I really love everything a computer has to offer to the users.</p>
